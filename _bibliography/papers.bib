abstract = {Access to realistic data is essential for various purposes, including training machine learning models, conducting simulations, and supporting data-driven decision making across diverse domains. However, the use of real data often raises significant privacy concerns, as it may contain sensitive or personal information. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution to this problem by generating synthetic datasets that closely resemble real data. Nevertheless, these models are typically trained on original datasets, which carries the risk of leaking sensitive information. To mitigate this issue, privacy-preserving generative models have been developed to balance data utility and privacy guarantees. This paper examines existing generative models for synthetic tabular data generation, proposing a taxonomy of solutions based on the privacy guarantees they provide. Additionally, we present a decision framework to aid in selecting the most suitable privacy-preserving generative model for specific scenarios, using privacy and utility metrics as key selection criteria.},

abstract="There is a wide range of tabular data of great value to science, economy and social progress. When sharing such data, privacy must be taken into account. Traditionally, this has been addressed through anonymization. However, in recent years, with the growth of AI, the possibility of using generative models has emerged as a way to generate synthetic data that guarantees privacy while maintaining their utility. This systematic literature review aims to identify and classify existing privacy-preserving tabular generative models in order to create a taxonomy of solutions. In addition, we analyze the privacy metrics and techniques they use, and identify possible unexplored lines of research.",
